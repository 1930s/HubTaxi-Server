### Setup:
- Clone this repo to your local machine by: `git clone https://github.com/vsoft-lab/HubTaxi-Server`.
- Okay, after clone it, you can install all dependencies by type: `npm install` on your terminal.
- I used to mongo database for this repo, because you must install and start mongodb. In your terminal: `sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb start`
- Finally, you can start server with command: `npm start` and then, your server will start at `http://localhost:6868`

Hi

I am Tung Nguyen, founder of VSOFT SOLUTIONS. Here is my story:

- From Nov 2013 to Apr 2014: our company developed Hubtaxi, an app that allows users to 

connect with cab drivers fast, smartly and conveniently. During that time, our investors invested 

$30000 for the first phase of the project, with the belief that we could achieve successes due to 

the fact that major taxi apps, like Uber, GrabTaxi and Easytaxi, hadn’t set their feet on Vietnam 

yet.

- From May 2014 to Nov 2014: we entered the second phase. However, this time we faced the 

above three major taxi apps. With big finance resources, they invested huge sums of money in 

Vietnam, and those amounts easily surpassed the total amount of money we invested for the 2 

phases. As a result, we had to cancel the project in July, 2014.

Even the project failed, I still didn’t want to waste the efforts of people who participated in this project. 

So I came to a decision that I will share this project in Github for everybody to learn from.  Of course at 

that time I didn’t have any intention to continue the project.

But now with the new incentive and refreshment of mind, I want to have a strategic partner who will 

support and realize the success of this project in any market of the world.

I’m always happy to discuss with you about the technologies and products.
